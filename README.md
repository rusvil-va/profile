# 🚀 Automation & AI Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Russel Villota** — an Automation Specialist and AI enthusiast with a background in **Computer Science** and hands-on experience integrating CRMs, APIs, and AI platforms.  

I started with **GoHighLevel (GHL)** automations, expanded into **third-party integrations**, and gradually built a foundation in **custom API development**, **Apps Script**, and **n8n**.  
Everything you’ll find here is something I learned, built, debugged, and iterated on myself.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Automation Platforms:** n8n, Zapier, GoHighLevel, Make  
- **Programming:** JavaScript, Google Apps Script, basic Python  
- **APIs & Integrations:** OpenAI API, Anthropic (Claude + Claude Code), Vapi, Retell, Google APIs (Sheets, Docs, Drive, Workspace, Marketplace), Salesforce, LeadPerfection, ActiveProspect  
- **AI Platforms:** ChatGPT (Custom GPTs + Actions Schema), Claude Code, Anthropic API  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **Other Tools:** Postman, Notion, VideoAsk, Monday.com

## 🧠 Highlights

### 🔹 1. GHL Automations & Integrations
Automated marketing, CRM, and lead management processes across GoHighLevel and external tools — with logic syncing between systems.

- GHL → 3rd-party app → GHL loops  
- Triggered workflows via Webhooks, API calls, or Apps Script bridges  
- CRM integrations with Salesforce, LeadPerfection, and ActiveProspect  

### 🔹 2. Google Apps Script Projects
Developed scripts and lightweight UIs connected to Google Sheets and external APIs.  
- Apps Script ↔ GHL integration for client onboarding  
- Apps Script web app UI hosted on GitHub  
- CRM syncs and automation monitoring dashboards  

### 🔹 3. n8n Workflows
Explored custom nodes, API authentication, and AI-assisted flows:
- **Inbound AI Agent (Vapi + GHL)** — connects via Google Workspace and Marketplace APIs for call routing and logging  
- **AI Call Agent (Retell + GHL)** — handles inbound call logic and post-call data sync to GHL  
- **SEO Content Generator** — multi-API workflow combining:
  - OpenAI API and Anthropic API for AI content generation  
  - Google Docs + Sheets API for storing and organizing content  
  - Google Drive API for saving Markdown outputs  
  - Custom JavaScript nodes for logic, formatting, and document automation  

### 🔹 4. API Integrations
I actively read **API documentation** rather than relying solely on AI output — it’s more reliable for debugging and ensuring schema accuracy.  

I’ve built:
- GHL → OpenAI (Custom GPT + Actions Schema)  
- GHL → Claude → GHL  
- GHL → Google → Drive → Markdown  
- GHL ↔ Vapi ↔ Retell integrations for AI voice automation

## ⚙️ Points of Improvement

I’m continuously expanding my knowledge in:
- **Pagination handling** for large data sets  
- **HMAC signature authentication** for secure API calls  
- **Rate-limiting strategies** for high-volume workflows  

Whenever I find something I don’t know — I **learn it**, **build it**, and **improve it**.

## 🧩 Current Focus

Right now, I’m deepening my skills in:
- Advanced n8n automation logic and error handling  
- Structured AI integrations using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs  
- Creating clean and reusable documentation for each workflow
